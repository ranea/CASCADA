CASCADA (Characteristic Automated Search of Cryptographic Algorithms for Distinguishing Attacks)
is a Python 3 library to evaluate the security of cryptographic primitives,
specially block ciphers, against distinguishing attacks with bit-vector SMT solvers.

A detailed introduction of CASCADA can be found in the paper
*CASCADA: Characteristic Automated Search of Cryptographic Algorithms for Distinguishing Attacks*.

CASCADA implements several SMT-based automated search methods to search for
characteristics and zero-probability properties to evaluate the security of ciphers against:

- differential cryptanalysis
- related-key differential cryptanalysis
- rotational-XOR cryptanalysis
- impossible-differential cryptanalysis
- related-key impossible-differential cryptanalysis
- impossible-rotational-XOR cryptanalysis
- linear cryptanalysis
- zero-correlation cryptanalysis

The online documentation of CASCADA can be found `here <https://github.com/ranea/CASCADA.git>`_.


Installation
============

CASCADA requires Python 3 (>= 3.10) and the following Python libraries:

- cython
- sympy
- bidict
- cffi
- wurlitzer
- pySMT

These libraries can be easily installed with pip::

    pip install cython sympy bidict cffi wurlitzer pysmt

CASCADA also requires an SMT solver supporting the bit-vector theory,
installed through `pySMT <https://pysmt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#getting-started>`_.
For example, the SMT solver boolector can be installed through pySMT by ::

    pysmt-install --btor

Optionally, hypothesis can be installed to run the tests,
and sphinx and sphinx-rtd-theme to build the documentation.
